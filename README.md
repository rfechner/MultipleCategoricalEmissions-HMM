# MultiEmissionCategoricalHMM

A simple python implementation of Hidden Markov Models, capable of dealing with **multiple** discrete categorically distributed emission signals $Y^{(k)} \sim \text{Cat}(p^{(k})$ per timestep (not to be confused with multiple observation sequences, although this implementation supports these aswell).

Please refer to the jupyter-notebook `hmmstudy.ipynb` for an in depth coverage and derivations
